lists are to maintain certain items
--menu(list of food items)
-- courses
-- attendance
-- list of bills
-- grocery lists
-- shopping list
-- playlist

Lists are basically three types
1. ordered lists: In ordered lists, elements/items order is important
eg: <ol>
<li>gfhj</li>
<li>fh</li>
</ol>
By default elements are in number order , we can also provide orders such as 'A','a','I','i' through type attribute. we can start from anywhere using start attribute

2. unordered lists: By default elements are in bullet points/dots. here order is not important
eg: <ul>
<li>fghfdh</li>
<li>jhgf</li>
</ul>
it is not recommanded to change li type in html
3. definition lists:
Definition lists are used to provide definitionsthrough dl tag. Inside 'dl' , we provide 'dt' and 'dd'
dt --> definition term
dd --> definition data
