Table is a representation of data in rows and columns
Eg: screener,crickbuzz, amazon comparison
table is done by table tag
inside the table, we can define tr - table rows
Inside tr, we can give td(table data) or th(table head)
by default th will be bold and centered

To combine rows , we can use an attribute rowspan="no_of_rows"
To combine columns, we can use an attribute colspan="no_of_columns"

we can give border by border attribute of table
we give give gap inside the cells using an attribute cellpadding
we can give gap outside / between the cells using an atrribute cellspacing

we can make search engines understand our code well by defining
thead,tbody,tfoot

we can give caption to mention the title of table at center
